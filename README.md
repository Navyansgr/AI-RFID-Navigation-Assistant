### ðŸŒŸ Project Overview

This project develops an **AI-powered navigation assistant** designed to enhance the independent mobility and safety of visually impaired individuals. By leveraging **RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) technology** and intelligent processing, the system provides real-time, context-aware audio guidance, enabling users to navigate unfamiliar indoor and outdoor environments with confidence.

It's an end-to-end solution demonstrating the integration of hardware (RFID readers/tags), data processing, and AI to solve a critical accessibility challenge, built with considerations for real-world deployment and usability.

### âœ¨ Key Features & Functionality

* **Precise RFID-Based Localization:** Utilizes strategically placed RFID tags and a portable RFID reader to pinpoint the user's exact location within a mapped environment.
* **Intelligent Path Guidance:** An AI module processes location data and provides contextual, turn-by-turn audio instructions (e.g., "You are approaching a staircase, turn left for the elevator," or "Proceed straight for the exit").
* **Point-of-Interest (POI) Announcement:** Automatically announces nearby points of interest (e.g., "Restroom to your right," "Cafeteria ahead").
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Primarily audio-based for the visually impaired user, with a potential companion mobile app or dashboard for caretakers/administrators to manage maps and RFID tag locations.
* **[Optional Feature based on your image: "AI-POWERED RFID NAVIGATION ASSISTANT FOR VISUALLY IMPAIRED" - this is consistent. If there's another hidden feature from the image like obstacle detection, add it here.]**
