Project Overview
This project leverages RFID technology to assist visually impaired users in navigating unfamiliar places, especially in tourist locations. The system uses a portable RFID reader integrated with a mobile device or speaker that detects RFID tags placed in strategic locations. Once a tag is detected, a voice message is played, informing the user of their current position and nearby points of interest, allowing them to move around with ease.

Features
Real-Time Audio Guidance: Instant voice alerts guiding the user to the nearest RFID tag location.

RFID Integration: Uses RFID tags and readers to provide location-based information.

Portable Reader: A handheld or wearable device equipped with an RFID reader that connects to a speaker or mobile device.

Voice Alerts: Converts text-based location data into voice messages using text-to-speech APIs.

Cloud Updates: Dynamically update the RFID tagsâ€™ locations and content via the cloud, ensuring the latest information is always available.

Tech Stack
RFID Technology: To detect location-based tags.

Arduino: For interfacing the RFID reader hardware and processing data.

Python: For logic and microcontroller programming.

Text-to-Speech API: For converting the location information into audible messages.

Cloud: For dynamically updating tag location mappings.

Installation
Clone the Repository
Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Navyansgr/AI-RFID-Navigation-Assistant
Setup Arduino

Download and install the Arduino IDE.

Upload the provided Arduino code to the board for interfacing with the RFID reader.

Install Python Dependencies
If you're running the Python-based text-to-speech functionality, make sure to install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pyserial pyttsx3 requests
Usage
Connect the RFID Reader
Connect the RFID reader module to the Arduino, and ensure the device is powered.

Run the Python Script
Run the Python script to start the RFID location detection and text-to-speech functionality:

bash
Copy
Edit
python rfid_navigation.py
Listen to Audio Alerts
The user can now walk around, and the system will provide audio alerts when an RFID tag is detected, guiding them to points of interest.

How It Works
The system uses a combination of hardware and software components:

RFID Tags: RFID tags are placed at various points of interest.

RFID Reader: The user carries a portable RFID reader that scans nearby RFID tags.

Arduino Integration: The Arduino reads data from the RFID reader and sends it to the connected system.

Text-to-Speech: The detected data is processed, converted to text, and then read aloud to the user using a text-to-speech engine.

Cloud Connectivity: The system can be updated dynamically via the cloud to include new RFID locations or modify existing information.
